## Important Reminders

When requesting a PR based on a conversation, please ensure you provide:

1. **The chat conversation** - the series of user/assistant exchanges discussing the feature, bug fix, or programming task
2. **The file(s) to be added** - the code or content you want included in the PR
3. **Any relevant context** - project structure, requirements, or background information

Without this information, it's difficult to create an accurate and complete summary or implement the requested changes.
