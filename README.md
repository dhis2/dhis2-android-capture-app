# SEMIS App

The **SEMIS** app is a  student-staff-school management suite developed in collaboration with Ministries of Education in the Global South. Tailored to meet core needs for enrolling and managing students and staff, SEMIS empowers staff to efficiently handle tasks like attendance tracking, promotion, repetition, transfers, graduation, and managing assessment data. The app supports both web-based and offline Android mobile data entry, ensuring accessibility even in low-connectivity regions.
