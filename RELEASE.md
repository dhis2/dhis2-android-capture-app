# Release notes - Android App for DHIS2 - 3.2.1.2

A translations-only patch. This version does not introduce any new features,
UI changes, or bug fixes. It simply updates the app's translations based on recent
contributions from the community via Transifex.
This patch is particularly important for countries and implementations
that rely on up-to-date local language support for end users.
If your project depends on recent translation updates, we recommend deploying this APK.


This patch release includes updated translations and a hotfix addressing an issue affecting metadata synchronization.
Bug fix included
Metadata sync not finishing in certain configurations (ANDROSDK-2164): In some specific scenarios, the metadata synchronization process did not complete as expected. This hotfix ensures metadata sync now works correctly across those configurations.
Translations
This release also includes updated translations contributed by the community.
