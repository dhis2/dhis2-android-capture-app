# Release notes - Android App for DHIS2 - 3.2.1.1

### Translations

A translations-only patch. This version does not introduce any new features,
UI changes, or bug fixes. It simply updates the app's translations based on recent
contributions from the community via Transifex.
This patch is particularly important for countries and implementations
that rely on up-to-date local language support for end users.
If your project depends on recent translation updates, we recommend deploying this APK.
