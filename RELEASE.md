## NEW FUNCTIONALITY AND WEB PARITY

**New Capture Coordinates process:** The 3.1 version introduces a list of new features designed to enhance the capture coordinates process. These improvements aim to provide greater accuracy, flexibility, and control over location data capture.
- **Accuracy:** The capture coordinates process now includes a feature that displays the precision of the captured location. This allows users to see how accurate their location data is in real-time. This parameter can also be restricted using the Android Settings WebApp.
- **Search Functionality:** A new search functionality has been added, allowing users to look up specific locations by name or address. Users are also able to navigate through the map and perform area searches to discover other locations within a specified region.
- **Block Manual Capture:** Using the Android Settings Web App, administrators now have the option to block manual location capture. When this setting is enabled, users can only capture the current location and cannot manually select or search a different one. This ensures that location data remains consistent and accurate.

## CROSS PRODUCT

**Support for customized Tracker terminology:** Some DHIS2 terminology is not familiar for the end users. For this reason, we are gradually enabling the possibility to customize it to each particular use case. In this version, the term "event" (program label context) is customizable. The admin user will be able to configure it for each program using the Maintenance App, and the Android Capture App will display the customized term instead of the generic one.
