# DHIS 2 Android Capture App - Documentation

This folder contains several subfolder related to the documentation of the DHIS 2 Android App. The main documentation of the Application is under the specific folder but other folders have been added to include documentation related to the Application. 

Current documentation has only been written in English although the folder structure is already prepared to support different languages.

In order to create new documentation:

* Create a new folder under src/commonmark/en/content/(name) and add all the doc files there
* Create an index in the folder src/commonmark/en as (name)\_INDEX.md
* Create a new index file in the [DHIS2-doc](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-docs/tree/master/src/commonmark/en) poiting to the INDEX.md created
