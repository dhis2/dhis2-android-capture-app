## Filter

<!-- PALD alternative: "The Filter allows you to narrow down the data available from the ..." -->
The app has new and improved filters for all listing screens (home, event listing, tei search and dataSets).

Filter by period, org. Unit, sync state, event status and category option combination.

Filters will adapt to the different programs and data sets. 
1. Program without registration: Period, Org. Unit, Sync State, Event Status and, Category Combination.
2. Program with registration: Period, Org. Unit, and Sync State.
3. Data Sets: Period, Org. Unit, and Syn State.

## Sync Information

## Org unit

![](resources/images/image30.png){ width=25%}

The whole organisation unit tree is displayed. Organisation units not available for data entry will be colored in grey.
User must check the box to select the org unit wanted.


> **Caution**
>
>  Mobile users are not expected to access the org. unit hierarchy of a whole country. Maximum number of org units is difficult to set, as the App does not set the limit, but the resources on the device (memory, processor). We could say below 250 org units should be safe, but still believe that is a very big number for a mobile use case.

## Data Sets

The user can now enter aggregate data for an organisation Unit, a period and a set of data elements and send it to the server.

## Differentiating Data Sets, Tracker and Event programs

![](resources/images/image87.PNG){ width=25%}

> **Tip**
>
>  An easy way to differentiate them is by looking at the word at the bottom left corner. The word 'Event' will always be in event programs. In tracker will appear the name of the tracked entity type (person, patient, building, etc.). For data sets, the word 'DataSets' will be shown next to the number of records.

## Sharing Data

## Capture Coordinates

### TEI coordinates

Capture the TEI coordinates in the registration form.  Enable this feature in the TET feature type.

### Polygons

The app now supports the geoJSON format and the user is able to capture polygons.

## Images

ValueType image has been implemented app side.
This allows to pick an image for a data element or attribute and send it to the server.
For TEIs, the first data element/attribute with this value type and marked as displayed in list will be used as the TEI profile image.

## Display events and TEIs in maps

When a program stage or tracked entity type have a feature type (and for programs with registration the option displayFrontPageList is enabled) the listings can be switched to display the information in a map.
