# About this guide

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_this_guide_-->

The DHIS 2 documentation is a collective effort and has been developed by
the development team and users. While the guide strives to be complete,
there may be certain functionalities which have been omitted or which
have yet to be documented. This section explains some of the conventions
which are used throughout the document.

DHIS 2 is a browser-based application. In many cases, screenshots have
been included for enhanced clarity. Shortcuts to various functionalities
are displayed such as **Data element** \> **Data element group**. The
"\>" symbol indicates that you should click **Data element** and then
click **Data element group** in the user interface.

Different styles of text have been used to highlight important parts of
the text or particular types of text, such as source code. Each of the
