> The app needs to take into consideration if the user has the correct authority (‘Uncomplete events’) to reopen a completed event.

### Field completion percentage

The percentage of data completed in each event is shown in the top right corner of an event when it is opened after first registration.

> **Note**
>
>   The percentages will be adapted according to the effects of the program rules in the forms.

### Sections Navigation

The display for sections has been redesigned for a more simple user experience. In addition, the sections in enrollment form are now supported and are aligned with the design of the event sections.

### Reset Search Fields

All tracker programs will take the user to the search screen. The search fields are used to look up for a specific entity, and the circled arrow at the top right corner to reset the search. All fields will be blank for the user to do a new search.

At first, the user is obligated to do a search. if there are no coincidences, the search button will change to an ‘Add’ button for the user to create a new enrollment.

![](resources/images/image79.PNG){ width=25%}

### Search screen for all Tracked Entity Type

User is able to search across all program of one tracked entity type (TET). In the Search screen there is a drop down which shows all the programs available for the active TET (active TET is defined by the selection of the program in the home screen). That drop down should also have an option with TET name. (for example: person)

When the user selects that option, the search fields available will only be the TET attributes (no program specific attributes).
Search restrictions do not apply, because they belong to the programs.

![](resources/images/image44.png){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/image22.png){ width=25%}

The search will return the found TEI's in the local database and also those in the Search OU of the user (when user is online). For those found online, the user will have to select them and the whole record will be downloaded.


> **Note**
>
>  When configuring search org. units, make sure that your capture org. units are contained in your search org. units, to do that capture org. units have to be selected as well as search org. units.

### TEI Dashboard across programs

User can see the TEI dashboard without any program by selecting the TEI in the list if the search was without program.

The dashboards will show the list of active enrollments.

![](resources/images/image22.png){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/image38.png){ width=25%}

### TEI enrollment history and new enrollment

User is able to see the complete historical record of the TEI. Clicking on the top right corner menu, select "Program Enrollments" and a list of Active enrollments will be displayed, followed by a list of past enrollments (completed or cancelled), followed by the programs in which the TEI could be enrolled.
User can also return to the 'TEI Dashboard without any program' by selecting 'All enrollments'.

Users should be able to navigate to the different enrollments from the list.

![](resources/images/image40.jpg){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/image7.png){ width=25%}

### Delete TEI's & Enrollments

To delete a TEI or an enrollment, select In the TEI dashboard, the three dots menu.

Local TEI or Enrollment will be deleted from the database. Records that has been previously synced with the server will be marked for deletion if the user has the authority:

F_ENROLLMENT_CASCADE_DELETE</br>
F_TEI_CASCADE_DELETE

They will show in the TEI search list, but will not be accessible.

![](resources/images/image86.jpg){ width=25%}

### Group view of Program stages in TEI Dashboard

The TEI Dashboard offers now the possibility to change the list of events from the chronological view to a stage grouping view. The stage grouping view will group and collapse the events per program stage. Each program stage group can be expanded by the user and the events will be displayed chronologically.
