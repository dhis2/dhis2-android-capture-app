### Limitations { #capture_app_local_analytics_limitations }

Android uses tables and charts created using the web Visualizer app, however only the configuration parameters of the object are used by the Android App: data elements, indicators, chart type, title, periods...; all the aggregations are calculated offline by the android application. The results will be based on the data stored in the device at that exact moment. 

Since the aggregations and calculations displayed are calculated in the device, the implementation of analytics is limited compared to web. In summary the compatible and suported objects and features are:

   - Well formed analytic objects (series, categories, filters)
   - User has view access
   - Limitations for Pivot Tables
      - Number of header lines: 1
      - Number of header columns: 1
   - Limitations for Charts
      - Number of Series: No limit (but remember you are rendering in a small screen)
      - Number of Categories (doesnâ€™t apply for pie chart): No limit

There are many more restrictions which apply to Android Analytics regarding the many configuration options available in the Web Visualizer as well as the supported functions and calculations related to indicators and program indicators. [This table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1127cz7M0K4fux5CU0V54V2Z77NZWCr0BTrZ6jcCec4Q) summarises all supported features.
