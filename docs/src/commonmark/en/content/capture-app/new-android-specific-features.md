> **Warning**
> 
> In DHIS2 versions up to 2.30 if a user attemps an on-line login and their account has been disabled as explained in the [DHIS 2 Manual - Disable User](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en_full.html#disable_user) all the data will be wiped from the phone. Make sure that before disabling a user all the data has been synced or that you are using this feature to remotely wipe sensitive data in case of a device getting lost.
>
> Due to a change in the login API this feature is not available in 2.31, 2.32 and 2.33.

## Filter { #capture_app_generic_filter }


<!-- PALD alternative: "The Filter allows you to narrow down the data available from the ..." -->
The app has new and improved filters for all listing screens (home, event listing, tei search and dataSets).

Filter by period, org. Unit, sync state, event status, category option combination and "assigned to me".

![](resources/images/capture-app-image19.png){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/capture-app-image123.png){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/capture-app-image134.png){ width=25%}

Filters will adapt to the different programs and data sets.

1. Program without registration: Date, Org. Unit, Sync State, Event Status and, Category Combination.
2. Program with registration: Event Date, Date of enrollment, Org. Unit, Sync, Enrollment Status, Event Status and Assigned to me. The filter icon will show only if a list of events is available (Display front page list feature or search)
3. Data Sets: Period, Org. Unit, and Sync State.

### Assigned to me { #capture_app_generic_filter_assigned }

It is possible to filter events based on its assignment to the current user. The “Assigned to me” filter has been added to the single event program list, the TEI list and the TEI Dashboard and the map views. It will only be displayed when the active program is configured to assign events to users.

### Event Date/Date/Period { #capture_app_generic_filter_date }

- Today
- This week
- This month
- Yesterday
- Last week

### Event Status { #capture_app_generic_filter_event }

Filter the events by:

Multiple status selection is permited. Once you open a TEI, the filter will be kept in the dashboard and show only the events with the selected status.

Events shown are up to 5 years old.

### Date of Enrollment { #capture_app_generic_filter_date_enroll }

The 'Date of Enrollment' will apply to the Enrollment date of the TEI in the program. If there is more than one enrollment date, it should sort the results by the most recent one. The label of this filter will display when available.

### Enrollment Status { #capture_app_generic_filter_enroll_status }

The filter 'Enrollment status' offers three options: Active, Completed, Cancelled. Only one option can be selected at time. If you filter by "completed" and the TEI has more than one enrollment, the app will open the "active"  enrollment. To see the completed one, select the three dot menu at the top right corner of the dashboard and select "program enrollments".

### Follow-Up (New 2.5)

The 'Follow Up' filter allowes the user to filter out the TEIs that have been marked as 'Follow-up'. TEIs can be marked to be followed up in the TEI Dashbaord.

### Filtering added in TEI Dashboard: { #capture_app_generic_filter_tei }

Filters have been added to the TEI dashboard. It is possible to filter the events of a Tracked Entity Instance enrollment per period, organisation unit, sync status, event status, and user assignment.

## Sorting { #capture_app_generic_sorting }

Sorting has been integrated in the filter menu.

The sorting button will be on the filter bars with the following behavior:

- Repeated clicks keep changing the order to the reverse.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image135.png){ width=25%}

### Dates (Period, Date, Event Date or Enrollment Date) { #capture_app_generic_sorting_dates }

### Org units { #capture_app_generic_sorting_orgunits }

- List will be sorted in alphabetical order by org unit name.

### Enrollment Status { #capture_app_generic_sorting_enrollment }

> **Tip**

>  Edit parameters related to SMS gateway in the SMS Settings (Settings Menu)

![](resources/images/capture-app-image90.png){ width=25%}

> **Note**
>
>  Note that in order to user the SMS sync capabilities the SMS services needs to be enabled in the server side as described in the (official documentation)[https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/dhis2_user_manual_en/mobile.html#sms-service]. You can also find more information on how to use different gateways in the (Android Implementation Guidelines)[https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/dhis2_android_implementation_guideline/about-this-guide.html].

## Org unit { #capture_app_generic_orgunit }


![](resources/images/capture-app-image30.png){ width=25%}

The whole organisation unit tree is displayed. Organisation units not available for data entry will be colored in grey.
User must check the box to select the org unit wanted.


> **Caution**
>
>  Mobile users are not expected to access the org. unit hierarchy of a whole country. Maximum number of org units is difficult to set, as the App does not set the limit, but the resources on the device (memory, processor). We could say below 250 org units should be safe, but still believe that is a very big number for a mobile use case.

## Data Sets { #capture_app_generic_datasets }


The user can now enter aggregate data for an organisation Unit, a period and a set of data elements and send it to the server.

## Differentiating Data Sets, Tracker and Event programs { #capture_app_generic_differentiating }


![](resources/images/capture-app-image87.png){ width=25%}

> **Tip**
>
>  An easy way to differentiate them is by looking at the word at the bottom left corner. The word 'Event' will always be in event programs. In tracker will appear the name of the tracked entity type (person, patient, building, etc.). For data sets, the word 'DataSets' will be shown next to the number of records.

## Sharing Data { #capture_app_generic_shargin }


![](resources/images/capture-app-image72.png){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/capture-app-image73.png){ width=25%}

## Capture Coordinates { #capture_app_generic_capture_coord }


### TEI coordinates { #capture_app_generic_capture_coord_tei }


Capture the TEI coordinates in the registration form.  Enable this feature in the TET feature type.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image94.png){ width=25%}

### Polygons { #capture_app_generic_capture_coord_polygons }

The app now supports the geoJSON format and the user is able to capture polygons.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image95.png){ width=25%}

## Images { #capture_app_generic_images }


ValueType image has been implemented app side.
This allows to pick an image for a data element or attribute and send it to the server.
For TEIs, the first data element/attribute with this value type and marked as displayed in list will be used as the TEI profile image.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image98.png){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/capture-app-image100.png){ width=25%}

Open the TEI profile image by clicking on it.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image138.png){ width=25%}

## Display events and TEIs in maps { #capture_app_generic_display_events }


When a program stage or tracked entity type have a feature type (and for programs with registration the option displayFrontPageList is enabled) the listings can be switched to display the information in a map. Make the switch by clicking on the map icon in the navigation panel.


![](resources/images/capture-app-image101.png){ width=25%}
![](resources/images/capture-app-image102.png){ width=25%}

If the TEI has a profile image, the map will display it.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image103.png){ width=25%}

## Personalized Calendar View (New 2.5)

In the DHIS2 Android Capture App users can switch date selection from spinner to calendar view. In this version, the app will remember the last visualization selected by the user and use it the next time the user needs to select a date.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image177.png){ width=25%}

## Reason for non-editable data (New 2.5)

Data can be blocked for many reasons in DHIS2, because of access restrictions or expiration among others. When an Event, TEI or Data Set are not editable the user will be able to find the reason on the "Details" section.

The following list contains all possible reasons:

* Event completion
* Enrollment completion
* Expired event
* Closed organization unit
* Organization unit out of capture scope
* No access to capture data in the program or data set
* No access to a category option in the program or data set
