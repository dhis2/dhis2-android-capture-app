## Icon library for metadata { #capture_app_visual_icon_lib }


There are currently 134 icons available that you can choose from. You can search by name in the icon picker widget. Icons are available in positive, negative and outlined shapes. We will be adding many more icons in future releases.

Icons can be associated to programs, stages, data elements and the options of an option set. This is  configurable through the Maintenance App.

> **Note**
>
> This feature is available from DHIS 2 2.30 onwards

![](resources/images/capture-app-image13.png){ .center width=80% }

In the Android App icons render in the home screen to illustrate all the programs available to a user, or while adding an stage. For data elements and options, the icons render for single event programs, when a section contains a single DE, showing the option set as a matrix or sequence of images.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image26.png){ width=25%}

> **Note**
>
> Icons will initially only render in the new Android app. The new web-based Capture App will incorporate them in the near future.

We plan to expand the collection of icons on each future version of DHIS2- for that we need your help: we are seeking ideas for new icons - please submit yours using [this form](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1LmfYJQAu3KyDfkY3X6ne7qSsuTa9jXZhoQHzkDxeCdg&sa=D&ust=1557433016147000).

## Colour palette for metadata { #capture_app_visual_colour_palette }


Tracker and Event capture now have the ability to render colours for programs, stages, data elements and options in option sets. A colour picker is integrated in the Maintenance App, which shows as a palette, except for options which allows the selection of any colour.

![](resources/images/capture-app-image20.png){ .center width=80% }

In the Android App, the color will be rendered as background color for programs and stages combined with an icon (if selected). For options it renders as the background colour during data entry form for single event programs. When the user selects a program with an assigned colour, that colour becomes the background theme for all screens in the domain of the program.

> **Note**

> Colours will first be available in the new Android app, followed in future releases by the new web-based Capture App.

## Rendering Types for Program Sections (Improved 2.5) { #capture_app_visual_rendering_type }


![](resources/images/capture-app-image16.png){width=80% }

**Program Section**: when used in combination with icons, a Program Section with a single data element and associated Option Set can render the options in sequential or matrix layout (see screenshots). If the icon is not found, the app displays the DHIS logo.

This is available when:

1. Making a new enrollment.

### QR and Barcodes (Improved 2.5) { #capture_app_visual_render_qr }


Data elements or attributes type text can be also configured as QR or barcodes. When a Data Element or Attribute is rendered as QR/Barcode, the app will open the device camera to read the code image. When the QR/Barcode is a TEI attribute configured as searchable, the user will be allowed to scan the code in order to search and identify the Tracked Entity Instance. This will also work for option sets.

Barcodes also allow the user to manually enter the value.
