|isNotNull|Returns true if the element value is not missing (not null), otherwise false.|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-complete.png)||
|firstNonNull|RReturns the value of the first element that is not missing (not null). Can be provided any number of arguments. Any argument may also be a numeric or string literal, which will be returned if all the previous objects have missing values.|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-complete.png)||
|greatest|Returns the greatest (highest) value of the expressions given. Can be provided any number of arguments.|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-complete.png)||
