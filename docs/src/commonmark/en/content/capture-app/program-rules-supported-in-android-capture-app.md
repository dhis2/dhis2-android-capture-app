## Program rule Variable source types supported
| Variable type| Description of variable type| Program with registration| Program without registration| Notes on implementation|
|-|---|:-:|:-:|---|
|Data element from the newest event for a program stage|This source type works the same way as "Data element from the newest event in the current program", except that it only evaluates values from a specific program stage.|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-complete.png)|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-na.png)||
|Data element from the newest event in the current program (with registration)|This source type is populated with the newest data value collected for the specified data element within the enrolment.|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-complete.png)|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-na.png)||
|Data element from the newest event in the current program (without registration)|This program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value found within the 10 newest events in the same organization unit.|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-na.png)|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-complete.png)||
|Data element in current event (with registration)|Variable takes the data element&rsquo;s value from the current event.|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-complete.png)|![](resources/images/../../admin/icon-na.png)||

| V{program_stage_id}   | Contains the ID of the current program stage that triggered the rules. This can be used to run rules in specific program stages, or avoid execution in certain stages.
