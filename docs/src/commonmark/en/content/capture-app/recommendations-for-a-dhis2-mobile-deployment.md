## Testing and Piloting { #capture_app_recommendations_testing }

If you plan to deploy the DHIS 2 Android App in the field, you should first do a full round of testing of the app in you own configuration.

The app has been extensively tested with the demo servers, and during Beta testing it was tested against some real configurations as well. We know, however, that every DHIS 2 configuration is special in many senses, and might cause inconsistencies that we have not being able to identify.

It is strongly advised to carry out a comprehensive testing of the app in your own server before piloting it.
