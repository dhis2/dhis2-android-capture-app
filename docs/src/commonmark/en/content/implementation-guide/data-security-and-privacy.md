# Data Security and Privacy

With the new DHIS 2 Android Capture App, users will be collectinndividual data at the point of service provision, which is the lowesevel of direct data capture as it involves the direct beneficiary.
Capturing Data this way enables upstream analytics without compromisinn detail, makes downstream analytics possible, reduces error annables post hoc analysis to answer questions identified after datollection and system design. However, individual data brings additionahallenges for information systems, including considerations of securitnd privacy, considerations of readiness and capacity, as lower Iiteracy data collectors are provided with digital tools and additionaomplications with regards to analytics, storage and systeesponsiveness.

There is wide consensus on the need to provide a comprehensive datecurity practice. This comprehensive security practice should consideot only *confidentiality* and *integrity,* but also *availability oata*. Harvard Humanitarian Initiative has [stated](https://hhi.harvard.edu/publications/signal-code-ethical-obligations-humanitarian-information-activities) that information itself, including its generation, communication aneception, is a basic humanitarian need that should be afforderotection equal to other such traditional needs as food, water, shelter, and medical care. The Roadmap for Health Measurement anccountability (MA4Health), [stated](https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/fileadmin/uploads/hdc/Documents/the-roadmap-for-health-measurement-and-accountability.pdf) that “Public health and clinical care cannot be delivered safely, witigh quality, and in a cost-effective manner, without seamless, sustainable and secure data and information exchanges at all levels ohe health system”. Still, the capture and storage of personalldentifiable data introduces risk and a commensurate obligation foigorous privacy practices.

The University of Oslo is committed to the following:

1. Ensuring that the DHIS 2 software development and release process is subject to a transparent and rigorous security verification plan;
2. Through an action research approach, the university seeks to learn by doing in solidarity with others; 
3. Striving to develop, learn and share relevant, timely and useful information and tools to promote good security practice;
4. Access to any and all health information in the course of our practice will be governed by strict and mutual agreement;
5. Using the university's actions to provide good example of security practice.

There can be a tension between the health system’s need for identifiablata, and the patient’s right to privacy. In the absence of cleaegislation governing the collection and storage of personalldentifiable data, there are important concepts that should bnderstood and promoted by system owners and implementers. They include:

* **Right of access**. The right of access will be defined by the data protection regulations of each country. In general terms, it includes information about the processing purposes, the categories of personal data processed, the recipients or categories of recipients, duration of storage, information about the rights of the data subject such as rectification, erasure or restriction of processing, the right to object, information about the existence of an automated decision-taking process, including profiling, etc.  Please be aware of the regulations specific to your area and make sure you are ready to comply before you start collecting data.

 * **Right of erasure**. The right of erasure is also defined by the data protection regulations of each country. In general terms, personal data must be erased immediately where the data are no longer needed for their original processing purpose, or if the data subject has withdrawn his/her consent and there is no other legal ground for processing. Again please make sure you understand the regulations of your specific area and make sure you are ready to comply.

* **Data minimization**. The basic idea of data minimization is that data processing should only use as much data as is required to accomplish a given task. It also implies that data collected for one purpose cannot be used for another purpose other than original processing one without further consent.

* **Pseudonymization**. It is a data management procedure that makes personal data less identifiable while keeping it suitable for analysis and processing. It can be accomplished by replacing the value of some of the data fields by one or more artificial identifiers, or pseudonyms. Pseudonymized data can be restored to make individuals identifiable again, while anonymized data can never be restored to its original state. Depending on the regulations applicable to your area, you can define a Pseudonymization strategy that meets the regulations and meets your needs.

* **Traceability**. In order to use data effectively we need to ensure its integrity. In order to ensure its integrity, it is important to monitor these data when they are collected, processed and moved. You need to understand: “what”, “when”, “why” and “who”. Organizations that take advantage of traceability, are able to find data faster and are better able to support security and privacy requirements.

Based on the regulations of your territory and the complexity of youroject, including the level of potential risk, you must implemenppropriate technical and organisational measures, such aseudonymisation, data minimisation, audit logs, search restrictions,
granular sharing, etc, and integrate the necessary safeguards into thata processing in order to meet the requirements of the regulationhat apply to your region.

An adequate security / privacy approach for any DHIS2 implementatioapturing personally identifiable data would include the creation of lear policy naming an individual(s) with full access to the system,
with the responsibility to ensure the following. For any technicaupport on databases containing sensitive data, a signed NDA with lear end-date should be required for any third parties.

|   | Possible practical implementation |
|---:|---|
| **Right of access &  Right of erasure** | Giving access to the patient to his / her record electronically for its review or deletion is not available in DHIS 2 (2.32). You should ensure that you put in place other methods by which a patient can request a copy of his/ her record so he/ she can review it and request amendments or its deletion. If its deletion is not possible, you should anonymize the record by removing / replacing all identifiable data points. |
| **Data minimization** | Ensure that there is a valid reason for collecting personal identifiable data. Don’t collect unnecessary details which don’t serve a practical purpose in terms of data analysis or the need of finability of a patient record. For example, if the need for patient follow-up gets determined by a test result being positive, don’t collect patient name if the result is negative.|
| **Pseudonymization** | Consider using alternative values for recording information about certain procedures or conditions of a patient. Por example you can have a list of medical procedures / personal behavior / actions listed as a color list. This allows to do analytics, without revealing what could be a stigmatized procedure/ action/ behavior in a given territory. |
| **Traceability** | DHIS 2 provides detailed audit log for each data point. This includes the tracing of data captured via its web tools (from 2.22), as well as imported or via Android (from version 2.27). Currently (2.32) DHIS 2 does not provide a full deletion / anonymization export option, as deletion of a value preserves previous data in the audit log. For this reason, any sharing of exported data to outside parties should include manual removal of sensitive / identifiable data. |
