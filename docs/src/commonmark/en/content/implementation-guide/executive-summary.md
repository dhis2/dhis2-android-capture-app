# Executive Summary

## Background

The University of Oslo in response to the growing smartphone adoption rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries, added to the clear leadership of the Android Market Share, decided to build a new Mobile DHIS 2 Android Application, DHIS 2 Capture Android, which was released in September 2018. This work builds upon the lessons learnt from the previous mobile DHIS 2 Android Apps: Data Capture, Tracker Capture, Event Capture and Dashboard.

The DHIS 2 Capture Android Application is designed to facilitate working in settings with poor or no connectivity, since it allows the user to work offline and synchronize the data later when connectivity is available. It makes data collection easier, by bringing all DHIS 2 data models into a single, consolidated app. It is envisioned to be used by health workers (front line workers, service providers, health centers staffâ€¦) at health facilities and work directly done at community level.

DHIS 2 Capture Android Application is different from the web-based DHIS 2. The web-based DHIS 2 is meant to be used where users have access to larger screens and good internet connection. The Android App has been designed taking into consideration the user experience with smaller screens and with poor or no connectivity.

Research shows that a mobile eHealth App can be easily integrated into care, improving productivity. The App should facilitate client follow-up, data reporting, and decision-making. However, the feasibility and usability of the app can be negatively affected by high beneficiary volumes, staff shortages, and problems with the software and the devices. Real time monitoring, program investment and the right human resources will be needed for a successful integration of mobile client data apps for frontline health workers in rural and resource-poor settings [Rothstein JD1 et al. 2014](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijta/2016/2515420/).

## Objectives

The objective of this document is to provide a set of guidelines for the deployment of the Mobile DHIS 2 Capture Android Application. The steps of the deployment, which will be described in detail later in the document, include: 

1. Security and Data Protection aspects
2. Mobile devices requirements
3. Installation and Setup
4. Testing (internal testing and user acceptance test)
5. Field testing and Piloting
6. Scale up (app distribution, mobile device management, training)
7. Rollout

It is also included a document map which groups the sections of the document into the phases of a mobile implementation project. All aspects here represented should be considered at the beginning of the project and planned accordingly. This representation illustrates in which phase of the project they will be of critical importance.which summarized its key aspects and facilitates following up this guidelines in your project. It is important to highlight that the *cycle represented in the document map* considers the requirement gathering process finished. The document map can be found in the first section.

In the last section, it is included a checklist which summarized its key aspects and facilitates following up this guidelines in your project.

## Target Audience

This document is intended to be used by those leading the deployment process from its early phases, and should be shared with those involved in the process.
