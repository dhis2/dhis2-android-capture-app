> This is the same information that can be found in the [Android Implementation Guidelines](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/dhis2_android_implementation_guideline/scale-up.html#mobile-device-management). Soon that section will be deprecated in favor of this document but it is kept here for historical purposes.

“_Mobile Device Management refers to  software used for the administration of mobile devices. You will need an MDM software when you have to support hundreds of devices and it becomes necessary to control the apk file distribution across the devices, provide tech support and enforce institutional policies. Most options are offered as monthly-fee services. Some free apps offer kiosk mode, but charge a monthly fee for basic remote management_.”

The desirable features of an MDM software can be classified as basic and advanced. Here is a list of the desirable features:

*   Basic features:
    *   Require a screen lock password
    *   Provision of authorized apps
    *   Lock devices and wipe information if they’re lost or stolen
    *   Control the upgrade of the Android App
    *   Enforce backup policies
*   Advanced features:
    *   Enforce password strength policies
    *   Enforce network usage policies
    *   Track device location
    *   Restrict access to settings and features (example - wifi/network, screen capture)

When deciding which is the best MDM software for your needs you should try to answer the following questions:

*   How many devices do I need to manage?
*   How often do I have physical access to the device?
*   Which features do I really need?
*   Which policies do I have to implement
*   How hard will it be to install and maintain
*   How will it affect the user experience?
*   Do we need to allow BYO? (Bring Your Own Device).
*   How will it affect the device?
